The linked_list_file program maintains the student information in a file.
When the program is executed then it checks if the file contains the linked list or not, if not then it starts from the beginging writing to the file.
If the linked list do exists then imports the linked list to the program and then does operations on the program like appending the list, deletion of student info.
